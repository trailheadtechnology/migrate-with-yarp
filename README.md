# Old to Gold: How to Modernize Your Legacy ASP.NET Apps Gradually
Talk by Jonathan "J." Tower

Legacy applications built with ASP.NET can take a long time to migrate. Doing this work all at once isn't very agile, so in this session we'll explore using YARP (Yet Another Reverse Proxy), .NET Upgrade Assistant, and the "Strangler Fig" pattern to incrementally migrate your legacy ASP.NET applications to modern technologies like ASP.NET Core.

While it might have a funny name, YARP is a very serious tool when it comes to helping you upgrade your legacy ASP.NET projects to ASP.NET Core. The best part is, it helps you do the upgrade gradually and with minimal impact to your users. When done with the help of the .NET Upgrade Assistant, you can also kick off the process without breaking a sweat.

You'll walk away more knowledgeable about these tools that help you with your migrations, and learn some of the shims that are available the make certain cross-cutting concerns easier to integrate between your legacy and modern applications. If you might have a legacy migration in your future, you're going to want to join us for this!
