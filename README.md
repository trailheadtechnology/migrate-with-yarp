# Old to Gold: How to Modernize Your Legacy ASP.NET Apps Gradually
Talk by Jonathan "J." Tower

We've all said it. “Why did they do it like that?” Without Architectural Decision Records (ADRs), these mysteries are inevitable. But don't fear, ADRs don’t mean boring documentation—these lightweight notes capturing the "why" behind your team’s decisions, saving you from future frustration and misunderstandings.

In this session, we’ll explore:
* Why teams forget their own decisions (spoiler: memory isn’t version control).
* How to write ADRs that are concise, useful, and not boring.
* Funny examples of what happens when ADRs are missing—and how they can save your sanity.

Say goodbye to “What were they thinking?” and hello to “Oh, that’s why!”
